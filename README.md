#### /Playwright tests/testing-project

In the case of the Playwright tests, we have deployed an application using React and the Playwright framework itself.

- React
    ```
    https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
  ```
- Playwright
  ``` 
    npm init playwright@latest
  ```
We have used NodeJS for dependency and package management

- NodeJS
